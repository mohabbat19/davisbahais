                    details: "Bahá'ís see the young as the most precious treasure a community can possess. In them are the promise and guarantee of the future. Yet, in order for this promise to be realized, children need to receive spiritual nourishment. In a world where the joy and innocence of childhood can be so easily overwhelmed by the aggressive pursuit of materialistic ends, the moral and spiritual education of children assumes vital importance. Bahá'í classes and activities for children are raising a new generation of spiritually vibrant young people with the potential to grow up free from prejudice. Children learn that they are important to God and that they have a critical role to play in serving humanity and bettering the world. Through music, stories, art, games, drama, and community service children learn about spiritual qualities, such as truthfulness, humility, and justice that will shape their lives and guide their choices."

The Junior Youth Spiritual Empowerment Program is designed to assist youth around the ages of 12 to 15 to navigate a crucial stage in their lives by helping them to form a strong moral identity and empowering them to contribute to the well-being of their communities and society at large. By developing their spiritual qualities, intellectual capabilities, and capacities for service, the participants come to see that they can become agents of positive change in the world. The program adopts a participatory mode of learning where the facilitator and participants learn from each other. Groups of participants engage in activities such as artistic expression, discussion, drama, cooperative games, the study of literature, storytelling, and acts of community service."

                    details: "Bahá'ís in Davis and in communities in every country around the world offer free study circles designed to provide participants with the knowledge, spiritual insights and skills to enable them to contribute to the betterment of society, starting with their own neighborhood. This is accomplished through a systematic study of a sequence of courses based on the Bahá'í Writings called the Ruhi Institute. Participants of the study circle study materials based on concepts relating to individual and collective spiritual development. Some of the main concepts explored are how to: create and maintain an environment that helps people develop their intellectual and spiritual capacities; foster a devotional character within a community through prayer and meditation; strengthen bonds of friendship and camaraderie among all people; make the education of children and empowerment of youth an integral part of community life. Study circles are conducted in informal settings with a small group of participants and are facilitated by a trained, volunteer tutor whose primary role is to guide the discussion between the participants and ensure the environment fostered by the group is one of inclusion, respect, and unity. In response to the materials they study, participants in study circles arise to carry out specific acts of service relating to the themes discussed, including organizing devotional gatherings, spiritual education classes for children and youth groups. As participants complete the sequence of Ruhi Institute courses, they have the opportunity to tutor and accompany others along this path of service. As people engage in study circles, they develop a common vision of individual and collective transformation and they undertake related acts of service. This gradually builds the capacity of the community to reflect a pattern of life that places social transformation and fellowship at its heart. Anyone aged fifteen or older, whether a Bahá'í or not, is welcome to take part in the Ruhi Institute."

                                It's no secret that America is going through a tumultuous time. Tensions and divisions surface every day, reminding us that the stains of injustice and racial prejudice are set deeply in the fabric of our society. Bahá'í's are committed to reshaping society around principles of oneness – such as love, inclusivity, reciprocity, and diversity.
