Children learn that they are important to God and that they have a critical role to play in serving humanity and bettering the world.\n\nThrough music, stories, art, games, drama, and community service, children learn about spiritual qualities, such as truthfulness, humility, and justice that will shape their lives and guide their choices."

This is accomplished through a systematic study of a sequence of courses based on the Bahá'í Writings called the Ruhi Institute.\n\nParticipants of the study circle study materials based on concepts relating to individual and collective spiritual development. Some of the main concepts explored are how to: create and maintain an environment that helps people develop their intellectual and spiritual capacities; foster a devotional character within a community through prayer and meditation; strengthen bonds of friendship and camaraderie among all people; make the education of children and empowerment of youth an integral part of community life.\n\nStudy circles are conducted in informal settings with a small group of participants and are facilitated by a trained, volunteer tutor whose primary role is to guide the discussion between the participants and ensure the environment fostered by the group is one of inclusion, respect, and unity.\n\nAnyone aged fifteen or older, whether a Bahá'í or not, is welcome to take part in the Ruhi Institute."
