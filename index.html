In a world where the joy and innocence of childhood can be so easily overwhelmed by the aggressive pursuit of materialistic ends, the moral and spiritual education of children assumes vital importance.\n\nBahá'í classes and activities for children are raising a new generation of spiritually vibrant young people with the potential to grow up free from prejudice. Children learn that they are important to God and that they have a critical role to play in serving humanity and bettering the world.\n\nThrough music, stories, art, games, drama, and community service, children learn about spiritual qualities, such as truthfulness, humility, and justice that will shape their lives and guide their choices."

The Junior Youth Spiritual Empowerment Program is designed to assist youth around the ages of 12 to 15 to navigate a crucial stage in their lives by helping them to form a strong moral identity and empowering them to contribute to the well-being of their communities and society at large.\n\nBy developing their spiritual qualities, intellectual capabilities, and capacities for service, the participants come to see that they can become agents of positive change in the world.\n\nThe program adopts a participatory mode of learning where the facilitator and participants learn from each other. Groups of participants engage in activities such as artistic expression, discussion, drama, cooperative games, the study of literature, storytelling, and acts of community service."

This is accomplished through a systematic study of a sequence of courses based on the Bahá'í Writings called the Ruhi Institute.\n\nParticipants of the study circle study materials based on concepts relating to individual and collective spiritual development. Some of the main concepts explored are how to: create and maintain an environment that helps people develop their intellectual and spiritual capacities; foster a devotional character within a community through prayer and meditation; strengthen bonds of friendship and camaraderie among all people; make the education of children and empowerment of youth an integral part of community life.\n\nStudy circles are conducted in informal settings with a small group of participants and are facilitated by a trained, volunteer tutor whose primary role is to guide the discussion between the participants and ensure the environment fostered by the group is one of inclusion, respect, and unity.\n\nAnyone aged fifteen or older, whether a Bahá'í or not, is welcome to take part in the Ruhi Institute."
